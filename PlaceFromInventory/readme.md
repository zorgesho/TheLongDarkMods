# Place From Inventory

This mod allows to place items right from the inventory screen with a right mouse click. Also, it places any stackable items as one item (as stack).

---
Now you can press the right mouse button on any item in the inventory (**except water**) and switch to item placing mode. If you press the button on a stack of items then **entire stack will be placed as one item**. You can see the number of items in the stack by hovering crosshair over it.

Also, you can press the right mouse button on any clothing slot in the clothing panel to drop & place cloth item in that slot.

After exiting from the placing mode you'll be returned to the inventory/clothing panel.

Also, you can drop & place specified number of items as stack by holding _Control_ in the drop items panel.

**Warning**: avoid to drop multiple fresh saplings, guts or pelts as stack because if they become cured in that state then **entire stack will be turned into a single item**. Cured items can be dropped as stack safely.
