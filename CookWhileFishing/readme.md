# Cook While Fishing

This mod allows to cook the catched fish automatically without interruption of the fishing

---
In order to cook the fish/meat while fishing you'll need to have the fire in the stove. You can put the cooking pot on the stove before fishing in order to use the pot for cooking.

By default, only the fish (from your inventory) will be used for cooking. The meat will be used in case you begin to cook it before fishing.

Cooking will take same amount of time as if you do it manually, also you'll get same amount of skill points and oil from the fish.
