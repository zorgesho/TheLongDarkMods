# Save Anywhere

This mod allows to save and load anywhere in the survival mode like in the story mode. Also, it can disable permadeath.

---

This mod adds hotkeys for saving/loading in the survival/challenge modes. Like in the story mode, you can use **F5** to quicksave, **F6** to quickload and also **F7** (customisable via _SaveAnywhere.json_) to create the save file with the custom name.

When you save your game (quicksave/named save), a separate save slot will be created that **will not be overwritten** by survival autosaving. Autosaving
will still use the "original" save slot (original slot is shown in the details panel on the right side of the save slots list).

Mod also adds "**Load Game**" option to the pause menu in the survival/challenge modes, so you can load the game without quitting to the main menu.

Also, this mod **increases the number of available save slots** and **disables permadeath**. There are settings for the both features in _SaveAnywhere.json_.

**Be aware** that by default, if you delete the original save slot then all custom save slots related to that particular slot will be deleted too.
