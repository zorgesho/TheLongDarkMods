# Movable Containers

This mod allows to move some types of containers (inside one location and between locations).

---
You can move 10 types of containers (for now?). You can see all of them on the screenshot.

**Moving containers inside one location** is like moving any other object - just right-click on it and change is position/rotation. You can move empty/non-empty containers and while you're doing that, the weight of the contents (and the weight of the container) will be added to your inventory weight.

**Moving containers beetween locations** is a little bit tricky. For that, you need to right-click on the container and while you're in the placing mode you can press **the hotkey for the radial menu** to "pick up" the container (there is a new hotkey at the bottom center area of the screen in that mode). You can pick up **only one empty container**.<br>
The fact that you picked up the container will be indicated by **the icon at the bottom right corner of the screen**.<br>
Also, the weight of the container will be added to your inventory weight (indicated by the separate yellow number in the inventory panel).<br>

**To drop the container** you'll need to open the radial menu and switch to the Campcraft section. There you'll find "Place Container" option instead of "Snow Shelter" option (it'll switch back to "Snow Shelter" after you place the container).

Also, this mod adds some **UI tweaks**. When you hover your crosshair over any container, you'll see "[pickupable]" in case you can move/pick up the container. Also, for any searched container you'll see contents of the container (configurable in _MovableContainers.json_).
