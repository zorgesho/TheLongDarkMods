# Extra Hotkeys

This mod adds additional hotkeys for equipping gear items

---
This mod adds 15 new hotkeys for equipping various gear items without using the radial menu or cycling through items with a single hotkey.

You can assign hotkeys in the vanilla key bindings menu.
Assigning hotkeys is similar to the vanilla, except you can press **Escape** while binding the hotkey to clear the binding.

**Be aware**, that there is no conflict checks with vanilla/extra hotkeys.
